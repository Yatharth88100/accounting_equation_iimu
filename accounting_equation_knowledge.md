## Part 1: The Resources and Claims Model

<!-- CONCEPT_TAGS: assets, liabilities, capital, accounting_equation -->

### Fundamental Concept

Every business possesses **resources** (things of value) and these resources are **claimed** by two parties:
1. **Outsiders** (creditors, lenders) - who have provided resources on credit
2. **Owners** (proprietors, shareholders) - who have provided their own capital

This gives us the fundamental accounting equation:



Where:
- **ASSETS** = Resources owned by the business
- **LIABILITIES** = Claims of outsiders (amounts owed to creditors)
- **CAPITAL** = Claims of owners (owner's investment and accumulated wealth)

### Initial Understanding with Capital Transactions

At this basic stage, we only consider:
- **Capital Receipts**: Inflows that increase the capital (owner's investment)
- **Capital Expenses**: Outflows for acquiring assets that provide long-term benefits

**Key Principle**: The equation must ALWAYS balance. Every transaction affects at least two items.

### Types of Transactions at Basic Level

1. Owner introduces cash  
2. Owner introduces assets (in-kind)  
3. Purchase of long-term assets for cash  
4. Purchase of long-term assets on credit

## Part 2: Introduction of Income and Expenses

<!-- CONCEPT_TAGS: income, expenses, capital_adjustment -->

### Expanding the Capital Column

While the basic equation remains the same, capital changes due to business operations:



### Capital Column Structure



---

### Why Income increases Capital
<!-- CONCEPT_RULE: income_increases_capital -->

- Income represents value created by the business  
- All profits belong to the owners  
- Therefore, income increases the owner's claim on business resources  

---

### Why Expenses decrease Capital
<!-- CONCEPT_RULE: expenses_decrease_capital -->

- Expenses represent value consumed to generate income  
- All losses must be borne by the owners  
- Therefore, expenses decrease the owner's claim on business resources  

---

### Important Recording Rules
<!-- CONCEPT_RULE: capital_calculation -->

1. **Income** is always recorded with a **(+)** sign in the Income sub-column  
2. **Expenses** are always recorded with a **(-)** sign in the Expenses sub-column  
3. At any point:
